Developing Components in Isolation
storybook for React or other 3rd party tools can allow you to see the individual states
within component

->
store data in some sort of local storage?




broke the api with too many calls
https://medium.com/@peterekeneeze/build-a-react-js-weather-app-with-stateless-functional-components-e61567004b54
I should break this down into more parts 
reviewed the ways that this was setup with values being stored into state.


next steps: 
////////////////////////////////
need a button to go from hourly back to current weather
    I tried using the same trick for going from current to hourly
    but it's not working as expected
    might need to incorporate React router
    and use a link tag to get back.
need to research into this more.

add in some error checking, if someone tries to submit the form without the inputs return an error message.

geolocation for showing the current weather.
-> so that the end user doesn't have to search for the current weather.
setup urls on client side

probably doesn't hurt if whatever is serving 
it can serve the same html for all missing requests
///////////////////////////
tested sidebar which is broken.

button path is also not working under hourly.
 seems to be something with the conditional statements
 under hourly because changing something that shows the form also 
 makes it start with current.


I don't think I understand navigation / routing as well
following this tutorial
https://auth0.com/blog/react-router-4-practical-tutorial/

/////////////////////////////////////////
try the same method you used to go down from the parent to child
with conditional statements.
see if you can get this to work tomorrow.

pass the state down as props?
///////////////////////////////////////

have someone review the code for dry
-> figure out how to get it deployed correctly because
right now on git it's still showing create-react-app

still trying to work on the button issue
do something similar to how you got from parent to child?
