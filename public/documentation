Child-to-parent communication is a little more complicated. The standard way of doing this is to have the parent pass a function to the child through props. 
The child then calls this function at some point and passes it a value that the parent is supposed to react to. 
We then write the functionality for the parent's reaction inside the parent component.

current error:
I am using semantic ui to generate a table
I am using array.map to iterate over the values and display in the table
right now the data in the table is repeating and not doing the iteration

=> look into making a table using a function 
=> use a self expanding list?
